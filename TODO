- We won't be validating duplicate hotel names because we can have two hotels in the same city. We just need to inform the user that a previous one has been added and the address. If he really needs to add another one, a different one, he can continue.
- Take out 'List Your Hotel' link on 'Edit' page - Use blaze-layout for dynamic rendering.
- Include help text on forms.
- Do incremental validation on fields.
- We need to find a way to update nested arrays in place instead of unsetting and pushing.
- "rooms": {"Deluxe": {"summary": "1 Bed with pool view", "price": "10"}, "Standard": {"summary": "2 Beds with pool view", "price": "30"}}
- Now that we've stored rooms in the Hotel collection, we need to make them into their collection. That was a good lesson in saving nested objects.
- Airbnb grants not-logged-in users to the 'List Your Space' page and asks them to log in when they fill the form and click Continue. We should do this too.
- Add Delete button for room on the list, not on the form.
- We can clear form after successful submission by doing a $el.val('')
- Move saving feedback to add_room_type template.
- Attempt showing and hiding the various forms in editHotel instead of using Session.
