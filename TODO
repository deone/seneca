- We won't be validating duplicate hotel names because we can have two hotels in the same city. We just need to inform the user that a previous one has been added and the address. If he really needs to add another one, a different one, he can continue.
- Take out 'List Your Hotel' link on 'Edit' page - Use blaze-layout for dynamic rendering.
- Include help text on forms.
- Do incremental validation on fields.
- Airbnb grants not-logged-in users access to the 'List Your Space' page and asks them to log in when they fill the form and click Continue. We should do this too.
- Add Delete button for room on the list, not on the form.
- Move saving feedback to add_room_type template.
- Attempt showing and hiding the various forms in editHotel instead of using Session.
- After upgrading Meteor to 0.8.0, .fade (of hotelDeleteModal) stopped fading with modal. Only works in the absence of Router.go(), hence the need to fadeOut() explicitly. Even with explicit fadeOut(), the next page (hotelsList) and everyone clicked from it are frozen as if the modal is still active.
- We should re-write our javascript without jQuery, for performance sake.
