- We won't be validating duplicate hotel names because we can have two hotels in the same city. We just need to inform the user that a previous one has been added and the address. If he really needs to add another one, a different one, he can continue.
- Airbnb grants not-logged-in users access to the 'List Your Space' page and asks them to log in when they fill the form and click Continue. We should do this too.
- Re-write javascript to use pure JavaScript instead of jQuery, for performance sake.
- Use some graphic to represent rooms for better user experience or add room photo during creation. That way, a delete button can be displayed on click.
- Animate room creation.

BUGS
- After upgrading Meteor to 0.8.0, .fade (of hotelDeleteModal) stopped fading with modal. Only works in the absence of Router.go(), hence the need to fadeOut() explicitly. Even with explicit fadeOut(), the next page (hotelsList) and everyone clicked from it are frozen as if the modal is still active.
